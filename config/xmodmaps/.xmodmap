!use `xev` to see keycodes of keys


! move modifiers around
! normally:
!108 = Altgr
!64 = Alt_L
!105 = Ctrl_R
!37 = Ctrl_L
keycode 64  = Alt_L
keycode 108 = Alt_R
keycode 37  = Control_L
keycode 105 = Control_R

! right "Menu" key
keycode 135 = Super_R


! swap [Esc] and [Caps_Lock
!remove Lock = Caps_Lock
!keysym Escape = Caps_Lock
!keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
!add Lock = Caps_Lock
! change [Caps_Lock] to second [Esc]
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Escape = Escape
keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
! keycode 66 = Escape

!! swap '-' '_' ('minus' and 'underscore')
!keycode 20 = underscore minus


!! numpad pointerkeys config: swap Numlock with Shift+Numlock
!! keysym 0xfef9 = Shift_L+Num_Lock (Pointer_EnableKeys)
!! keysym 0xff7f = Num_Lock
!sadly, doesn't work so disabled
!keycode 0xfef9 = Num_Lock
!keycode 0xff7f = Pointer_EnableKeys
!remove Lock = Num_Lock

keycode 21 = plus equal
