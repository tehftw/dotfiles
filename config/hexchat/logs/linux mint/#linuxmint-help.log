Nov 13 21:32:26 <tehftw_>	Hello. I'm having some problem with Wi-Fi - the connection is working, but I want to switch to a different network( my router has 2.4G and 5G network, and I want to switch to 5G ).
Nov 13 21:32:26 <tehftw_>	I tried using `nmcli dev wifi` and `nmcli dev wifi list` to list the other networks as per archwiki's suggestions, however it only shows my currently connected network. There is a lot of other networks that also aren't listed by this program(my phone sees the others, but nmcli doesn't list them). I tried running nmcli with sudo, with sudo su, restarting all terminal windows, but it still only shows my current network. 
Nov 13 21:32:26 <tehftw_>	A minute ago I ran this command and it showed me all the other networks with signal strength at all, yet now, nothing. What could be the problem here?
Nov 13 21:32:26 <tehftw_>	I switched from the stock Xfce to i3wm(muh tilings), though honestly I don't want to go back to the Xfce just to check out the network manager, and I was looking for a commandline, nerdy way to fix it all.;w
